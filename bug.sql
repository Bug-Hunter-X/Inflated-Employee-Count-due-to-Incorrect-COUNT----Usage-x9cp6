The SQL query uses the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function incorrectly, leading to an inflated count.  The query is structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 50000;
```

If an employee belongs to multiple departments, this query will count them multiple times in the `COUNT(*)` result.  If the `employees` table has an employee record like this:

| employee_id | department | salary |
|---|---|---|
| 123 | Sales | 60000 |
| 123 | Marketing | 70000 |

The `COUNT(*)` will count this employee twice, leading to an incorrect count of employees in the Sales department with a salary exceeding 50000.  This scenario is uncommon but important in certain database configurations or applications where the employee record is designed to support multi-department assignments.
